Creating a frontend web application using react.js
Based on the [youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbV3zRgpw_E) by GreatStack.

After completing the MERN book store project, I actually found the front end part hard to follow along with, due to my lack of exposure to reactjs. This project hopefully helps me with that issue.
